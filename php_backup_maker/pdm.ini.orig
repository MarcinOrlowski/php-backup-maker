[PDM]

; you use 700 MB CDRs or (if you don't want to burn but to toss files only)
; all files will be placed in sets containing of max. capacity MB of data
capacity = 700

; 5 MB reserved for internal CD structures. 
; NOTE: read README for more details or you may waste some CDRs!
reserved = 5


;
; CDRECORD
;
; here we gonna set up some values for 'cdrecord' tool, to make CD burning
; possible. Make sure you got it all right!
;
[CDRECORD]

; if you want to burn anything, enable this feature first. Make sure you
; have cdrecord and mkisofs installed and available!
; Values: On/Off
enabled = Off

; use "cdrecord -scanbus" to find out your device settings and put the result
; (i.e. for 1st CD writer it will be something like "x,0,0")
; NOTE: don't put any /dev/xxxx here. CD-Record needs what's above.
; device 1,0,0 means master unit on 2nd IDE device (probably your case too)
device = "1,0,0"

; how many MB per fifo size (important when burning on the fly. If you got
; many small files to burn, You may consider increasing this value if RAM
; permits, however default 10MB should be fine for most uses
fifo_size = 10
