[CONFIG]
; version of the config file [v2.1+]
; the version value is calculated as follow: version*10+revision, so
; i.e. 21 menans version 2, revision 1. So if I incorporate any new
; features, I'll update this value and due to this, I'll be able to
; detect and inform you about new features you can configure. 
; NOTE: however you can put a BIG number here to quiet version notifier
; forever, I suggest not to do so. Just leave this as in pdm.config.orig
version = 22

;
; PDM - general settings...
;
[PDM]

; media - media type [v2.2+]
; all files will be placed in sets containing of max. capacity MB of data
; depending of media type. Known types (which also means capacity in MB)
; are: 184, 553, 650, 700, 800, 870. Default is 700
; this option replaces 'capacity' and 'reserved' which are no longer used
media = 700

; ignore_file [v2.1+]
; 'ignore' marker file - name of the file that indicates directory which
; should NOT be processed. I. e. if you have mp3/ direcotry in your home,
; putting this file in the root of this folder prevent it from
; being backuped. Defult is '.pdm_ignore'
ignore_file = .pdm_ignore

; ignore_subdirs [v2.1+]
; by default, PDM ignores also subdirectories of folder where ignore_file
; had been found. if you want to avoid this, set this to Off - in that
; case, only content of the directory will be forgotten. Subdirs (if any)
; will be kept
ignore_subdirs = On

; check_files_readability [v2.2]+
; by default, PDM will do additional checks to make sure each file can
; be read by the user it runs as. This slows thinks down a bit, but
; prevents you from facing mkisofs abort later on (say, in the middle of
; 6rd CD burning).
; ADVICE: do not turn it off for ordinary users. The only non-risky case
;         is when running PDM as root, so PDM will automatically turn
;         this off when launched as root
check_files_readability = On
;
; CDRECORD
;
; here we gonna set up some values for 'cdrecord' tool, to make CD burning
; possible. Make sure you got it all right!
;
[CDRECORD]

; device [v2.0+]
; use "cdrecord -scanbus" to find out your device settings and put the result
; (i.e. for 1st CD writer it will be something like "x,0,0")
; NOTE: don't put any /dev/xxxx here. CD-Record needs what's above.
; device 1,0,0 means master unit on 2nd IDE device (probably your case too)
device = "1,0,0"

; fifo_size [v2.0+]
; how many MB per fifo size (important when burning on the fly. If you got
; many small files to burn, You may consider increasing this value if RAM
; permits, however default 10MB should be fine for most uses
fifo_size = 10


[GROWISOFS]

; device [v4.0+]
; growisofs needs to know where's your DVD burned. Show him using this option
; Default points to /dev/dvd
; NOTE: growisofs uses STANDARD device naming scheme (i.e. /dev/dvd, /dev/xxx).
device = "/dev/dvd"


[MKISOFS]
; nothing at the moment

[SPLIT]
; buffer_size [v3.0+]
; Size, *always* in MB of internal splitting buffer. See README for more
; information about splitting feature and internal buffer management
; Default value is 0 (zero) which means PDM will automaticaly take care
; of computing buffer_size
buffer_size = 0
