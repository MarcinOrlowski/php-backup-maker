[CONFIG]
; version of the config file
; the version value is calculated as follow: version*10+revision, so
; i.e. 21 menans version 2, revision 1. So if I incorporate any new
; features, I'll update this value and due to this, I'll be able to
; detect and inform you about new features you can configure. 
; NOTE: however you can put a BIG number here to quiet version notifier
; forever, I suggest not to do so. Just leave this as in pdm.config.orig
version = 21

;
; PDM - general settings...
;
[PDM]

; you use 700 MB CDRs or (if you don't want to burn but to toss files only)
; all files will be placed in sets containing of max. capacity MB of data
capacity = 700

; 5 MB reserved for internal CD structures. 
; NOTE: read README for more details or you may waste some CDRs!
reserved = 5

; 'ignore' marker file - name of the file that indicates directory which
; should NOT be processed. I. e. if you have mp3/ direcotry in your home,
; putting this file in the root of this folder prevent it from
; being backuped. Defult is '.pdm_ignore'
ignore_file = .pdm_ignore

; by default, PDM ignores also subdirectories of folder where ignore_file
; had been found. if you want to avoid this, set this to Off - in that
; case, only content of the directory will be forgotten. Subdirs (if any)
; will be kept
ignore_subdirs = On


;
; CDRECORD
;
; here we gonna set up some values for 'cdrecord' tool, to make CD burning
; possible. Make sure you got it all right!
;
[CDRECORD]

; if you want to burn anything, enable this feature first. Make sure you
; have cdrecord and mkisofs installed and available!
; Values: On/Off
enabled = Off

; use "cdrecord -scanbus" to find out your device settings and put the result
; (i.e. for 1st CD writer it will be something like "x,0,0")
; NOTE: don't put any /dev/xxxx here. CD-Record needs what's above.
; device 1,0,0 means master unit on 2nd IDE device (probably your case too)
device = "1,0,0"

; how many MB per fifo size (important when burning on the fly. If you got
; many small files to burn, You may consider increasing this value if RAM
; permits, however default 10MB should be fine for most uses
fifo_size = 10
