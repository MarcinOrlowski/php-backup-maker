 Development history:
 ------------------------
 2003.01.13 - v2.0 - added support for configuration file (pdm.ini). Script
                     first tries to read ~/.pdm/pdm_config.ini then, if not
                     found, tries /etc/pdm/pdm_config.ini finally it tries
							./pdm.ini
                   - renamed scripts. The main script is now just pdm.php
                     to match SF and FM project name
                   - added more end-user-readable output for all filesizes.
                     Instead of just pure bytecounts like "219942106" you will
                     also face "210MB"
                   - checks PHP config agains safe_mode to avoid newbie
                     problems they may face when running with active SafeMode.

 2003.01.01 - v1.6 - code spead-up ('progress' is repored less often, which
                     speeds up data processing *significantly*
                   - script used to leave temporary CD sets if ordered to Abort
                     after the sets had been created, but before processed
                   - when in burn mode, it no longer asks to burn the CD 'again' 
                     if you wished not to burn the CD at all
                   - added config var to control FIFO size (important for all
                     on-the-fly burners)
                   - wrote some kind of documentation (check README ;-)
                   - modified configuration vars to be more self explanatory

 2002.12.10 - v1.5 - seems mkdir() needs now two parameters.

 2002.11.09 - v1.4 - changed the "Cleanup temp data question?",
                   - cleaned source code a bit, to better fit in 80 columns.

 2002.10.20 - v1.3 - added ability of re-burning given CD set (useful if you
                     i.e. procceed too fast, and cdrecord didn't burn anything
                     due to i.e. no blank cd found etc),
                   - reworked the 'UI' to be more friendly, and made most 
                     'requesters' to give 'positive' answer as default option,
                     which lets you process your data just with [ENTER] key 
                     for most the time...

 2002.08.13 - v1.2 - added "iso" copy mode, which acs like "link" but 
                     additionaly creates ISO images (requires mkisofs),
                   - added "burn" copy mode which burns cd set on-the-fly
                     (requires mkisofs and cdrecord). See $CD_DEVICE below!

 2002.07.31 - v1.1 - instead of moving files, the script now symlinks them 
                     by default (modify "COPY_MODE" to change this).

 2002.07.30 - v1.0 - initial release.
