PRICE?!
----------------

This software is released free of charge. This means you can grab it
and use without being obliged to pay any registration fee nor other license
penalties. However, if you have found my software useful for you or your client,
bussiness, whatever, and you found out you saved lot of your precious time
(and maybe even more precious money ;) using my code instead of developing
your own solutions, and you simply would sleep better having Your Trully
paid for his-really-god-job{tm}, then please browse my wish list,
I settled at Amazon.com for that occasion:

Enjoy and thanks for the fish,
